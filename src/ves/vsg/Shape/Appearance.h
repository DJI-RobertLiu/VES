/**
 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * The Appearance node specifies the visual properties of geometry. The value
 * for each of the fields in this node may be NULL. However, if the field is
 * non-NULL, it shall contain one node of the appropriate type.
 *
 * The material field, if specified, shall contain a Material node. If the
 * material field is NULL or unspecified, lighting is off (all lights are
 * ignored during rendering of the object that references this Appearance) and
 * the unlit object colour is (1, 1, 1). Details of the X3D lighting model are
 * in 17 Lighting component.
 *
 * The texture field, if specified, shall contain one of the various types of
 * texture nodes (see 18 Texturing component). If the texture node is NULL or
 * the texture field is unspecified, the object that references this Appearance
 * is not textured.
 *
 * The textureTransform field, if specified, shall contain a TextureTransform
 * node as defined in TextureTransform. If the textureTransform is NULL or
 * unspecified, the textureTransform field has no effect.
 *
 * The lineProperties field, if specified, shall contain a LineProperties node
 * as specified in LineProperties. If lineProperties is NULL or unspecified, the
 * lineProperties field has no effect.
 *
 * The fillProperties field, if specified, shall contain a FillProperties node
 * as specified in FillProperties. If fillProperties is NULL or unspecified, the
 * fillProperties field has no effect.
 *
 * The shaders field contains a listing, in order of preference, of nodes that
 * describe programmable shaders that replace the fixed rendering requirements
 * of this part of ISO/IEC 19775 with user-provided functionality. If the field
 * is not empty, one shader node is selected and the fixed rendering
 * requirements defined by this specification are ignored. The field shall
 * contain one of the various types of shader nodes as specified in 31
 * Programmable shaders component.
